# PhoenixZ-Roblox-Executor
A roblox executor i made a while ago, i dont have any use of it so i decided to post it here

This executor uses the **easyexploits dll**. Why?
Cause im to lazy to update all addresses everytime roblox updates so you will have to get their website opened every time you inject/attach the exploit
 
Dont click anywhere on the website and just close everything it opened

## How to use
Using this exploit is pretty simple
1. Disable realtime protection, your antivirus may delete required stuff if realtime protection is on
2. Download the PhoenixZ zip file from the [releases](https://github.com/robi0t/PhoenixZ-Roblox-Executor/releases/latest) tab and extract it

3. Open Phoenix.exe and roblox
4. Press attach and close the website it opened
5. Choose a script from the listbox at the right or get one from the internet and click execute `And boom`

## How to compile
If you would like to compile yourself then this is how
1. Open the .sln file with **Visual Studio 2019** 
2. Make sure its set to debug and "Any CPU" or x86
3. Compile!!!
  
## More Information  
This plugin was tested on a Windows10 x64 bit machine

Visual studio may give an message that says "Security Warning for Phoenix... You should only open projects from...", just click ok if you belive its trustworthy and if you don't check the sourcecode and you can check yourself :))

**If you experience any error or have a suggestion please let me know**
